"""Acceptance tests for the SQL state backend against a REAL PostgreSQL server.

These are the tests the SQLite-backed offline suite structurally cannot run. The
``audit.id`` defect shipped precisely because SQLite's ``INTEGER`` is already
64-bit: the deterministic NEGATIVE 63-bit surrogate key that
``SqlAuditRepository.write_strict`` derives from ``AuditDoc.event_id`` inserted
happily there, while on PostgreSQL every keyed strict write raised
``asyncpg.exceptions.DataError: ... value out of int32 range`` and took proposal
approve AND reject down with it (both append a decision audit row before
finalising, so both always returned 503).

Two things are proven here:

* a FRESH ``create_all()`` produces a 64-bit ``audit.id`` and accepts a keyed
  strict write;
* an EXISTING v0.1.13 deployment (``id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY``) is widened in place
  by :func:`app.stores.sql.engine.ensure_schema_migrations` — losing no rows,
  keeping plain autoincrement working, and running idempotently.
  ``Base.metadata.create_all`` only creates ABSENT tables, so without that
  in-place migration an upgraded deployment would stay broken forever.

Running these tests requires a PostgreSQL server. Point ``POSTGRES_TEST_DB_URL``
(or the backend's own ``STATE_DB_URL``, when it already names a PostgreSQL
database) at one::

    POSTGRES_TEST_DB_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres \\
        python -m pytest -q tests/test_postgres_state_acceptance.py

With neither set the whole module SKIPS — a developer without PostgreSQL never
sees a failure. CI's ``postgres-redis`` lane exports it against its live service,
so a regression fails the lane. The credentials URL is used only to CREATE a
throwaway scratch database per test; nothing is written to the database it names.
