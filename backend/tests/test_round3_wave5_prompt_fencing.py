"""Round 3 / Wave 5 — enrichment-line prompt fencing (OWASP LLM01 / Non-negotiable #9).

The research-confirmed injection hole: ``render_cluster`` used to interpolate the
provider-/attacker-influenceable enrichment fields — ``EnrichmentResult.country`` and
``json.dumps(EnrichmentResult.sources)`` (whose VALUES include provider ``*_error``
strings) — UNFENCED, directly into the ``ip_reputation`` line. Because that line feeds
BOTH the router prompt (``router.py`` -> ``render_cluster(..., None, max_events=6)``)
and the investigator prompt (``investigator.py`` -> ``render_cluster(..., rag_chunks,
playbook=..., memory=...)``), an attacker who controlled an enrichment provider's
response (a country code or an error string) could embed a forged ``UNTRUSTED_CLOSE``
to close the fence early and then a forged ``<<<PLAYBOOK>>>`` block to impersonate the
TRUSTED operator-procedure context and smuggle instructions into the model.

The fix fences the untrusted LEAVES — ``country`` and each STRING value in ``sources``
— via ``fence(..., source="enrichment")`` (which also neutralises forged fence /
PLAYBOOK / MEMORY markers), while keeping the deterministic numeric/bool CONTROL fields
(``reputation_score`` / ``is_malicious``) rendered plainly, exactly like ``risk_score``.

These tests assert, on the SAME ``render_cluster`` seam both prompt paths share, that:
  * a forged ``UNTRUSTED_CLOSE`` / ``<<<PLAYBOOK>>>`` in ``country`` is neutralised;
  * a forged marker inside a provider ``*_error`` value is neutralised;
  * the OPEN/CLOSE marker balance stays even (no live fence marker escapes a fence);
  * no live TRUSTED-block marker survives verbatim;
  * the injected text carries the ``source=enrichment`` provenance tag (i.e. is fenced);
  * the trusted numeric control fields are still rendered plainly;
  * the fix applies to BOTH the router and the investigator prompt assembly.

``case_manager.decide()`` is untouched (#3) — this is purely prompt-assembly hardening.
