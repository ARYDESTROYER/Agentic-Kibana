"""Round 3 / Wave 4 — RAG-fencing TRUSTED ALLOWLIST (OWASP LLM01 / Non-negotiable #9).

The research-confirmed injection hole: operator-/user-IMPORTED RAG documents used to
reach the model UNFENCED, so an attacker who got a doc imported could inject
instructions into the TRUSTED investigation/chat context.

The fix inverts the knowledge block to a TRUSTED ALLOWLIST (default-deny): only the
system-verified seed corpus (runbook / mitre / suppression) is rendered as TRUSTED
reference; ANY other retrieved chunk — imported docs, pasted threat-intel,
resolved-case (log-derived) text, unknown sources — is wrapped in the UNTRUSTED
fence (with provenance + forged-marker neutralisation) before it enters any prompt,
exactly like raw log evidence.

These tests assert:
  * the allowlist itself (default-deny);
  * an IMPORTED document with a forged instruction is FENCED + neutralised in BOTH
    the investigator (``render_cluster``) and chat (``ChatEngine._render_knowledge``)
    prompt-assembly paths;
  * a forged ``<<<PLAYBOOK>>>`` / forged UNTRUSTED marker inside imported content is
    neutralised so it cannot impersonate a TRUSTED block / close the fence early;
  * a built-in runbook stays TRUSTED (byte-identical to before);
  * the documented precedence (policy > base > playbook > memory > UNTRUSTED) holds
    in the investigator system prompt.

``case_manager.decide()`` is untouched (#3) — this is purely a prompt-assembly /
rendering hardening.
