"""Forwarding EXPLAINABILITY (Round 4 Wave 3) — a read-only "why did / didn't this
cluster auto-investigate?" narrator.

``explain_forwarding(cluster, prefs)`` reproduces — WITHOUT re-deciding anything — the
exact chain of gates that :func:`app.engine.ingest.handle_clusters` walks to choose
between ``pipeline.investigate_cluster`` (auto-forward to the LLM investigator) and
``pipeline.register_candidate`` (registered OPEN for manual triage). It returns a plain
python object (a :class:`ForwardingExplanation`) whose ``gate`` field names the FIRST
gate that decided the outcome, plus a one-line human-readable ``sentence``.

Design invariants (the same non-negotiables the rest of Round 4 holds):

* **#3 — a PURE, ADVISORY narrator.** It NEVER imports ``case_manager``, NEVER calls or
  reads ``decide()``, and NEVER changes a case's status/disposition. It only *describes*
  the deterministic auto-forward gate that runs BEFORE any verdict exists; the
  close/escalate decision stays a pure fn in ``case_manager.decide()``.
* **#4 — read-only.** It never recomputes / mutates ``cluster_signature``; it only reads
  the cluster's already-computed provenance flags (``is_alert``,
  ``auto_investigate_eligible``, ``source_id``, ``rule_values``).
* **#6 — no LLM call.** Pure logic over prefs + cluster → no ``UsageDoc``.
* **#9 — no prompt.** It builds no prompt over event bodies; the ``sentence`` it returns
  is a code-assembled summary of TRUSTED config/flags, never interpolated log text.

The gate order MIRRORS ``handle_clusters`` exactly so the explanation can never disagree
with what actually happened:

  1. ``ignored``            — every member belongs to an IGNORE feed → dropped entirely.
  2. ``suppressed``         — every member matches a live suppression rule → dropped.
  3. ``background_scan``    — the global automated-investigation switch is OFF.
  4. ``severity_floor``     — every member is below its feed's ``severity_floor``
                              (``cluster.auto_investigate_eligible`` is False).
  5. ``auto_correlate``     — the per-source and/or per-feed Auto-Correlate toggle is OFF.
  6. ``allowlist``          — an events-role cluster whose rules are not on the
                              auto-forward allowlist (and it is not an alerts-role
                              cluster) → candidate.
  7. ``forwarded``          — all gates pass → auto-investigated.

``cost_gate`` / ``budget`` are surfaced ADVISORY-only in the explanation's ``notes`` (they
are enforced deeper in the pipeline / by the pre-flight :class:`app.engine.budget.BudgetGate`,
which fails safe to NEEDS_HUMAN and never silently closes, #3) — they are NOT part of the
``handle_clusters`` forwarding branch itself, so they never override the seven gates above.

DEFAULTS OFF is not applicable here — this module is a pure read-time explainer with no
behaviour of its own; it changes nothing until a caller asks it a question.
