"""Multi-source poller fan-out (Round 4 #2/#3 root-cause fix).

Historically ``AppState`` wired ONE :class:`~app.engine.poller.Poller` to the single
``primary`` PULL source, so every other enabled PULL source was silently never
polled / correlated / triaged. :class:`PollerManager` fixes that by owning **N**
per-source :class:`Poller` children — one per enabled PULL source — while preserving
byte-identical single-source behaviour when 0 or 1 PULL source is configured.

Design (the fan-out + cursor-collision contract):
  * The PRIMARY child IS ``state.log_source`` (the connector ``state`` already built
    + owns, via ``_owned_log_client``). The manager never rebuilds it and never owns
    its client — so the sole-source path is byte-identical and the read/browse/chat
    surface (``state.log_source``) stays the primary connector.
  * NON-primary PULL sources get their OWN connector built exactly like
    ``state._build_log_source`` — ``state.es_client_for_source(src)`` (which forces the
    mgmt key to None, #1) + ``connector_id=src.id`` (so per-source
    auto_correlate/ignore/severity_floor gates work) — and every OWNED client is
    tracked + closed on rebuild/stop (no connection leak over N sources).
  * Each :class:`Poller` already fans out over its own feeds on
    ``f"{source.id}:{feed.id}"`` cursors. For an UN-FED source (only
    ``data_view_pattern``) the legacy union path keys the cursor ``"primary"`` — so
    the manager gives every NON-primary un-fed source a DISTINCT
    ``f"{source.id}:primary"`` key (via ``Poller._legacy_cursor_key``) while the true
    primary keeps ``"primary"`` (no migration, #4).
  * Children SHARE ``state``'s ONE pipeline/gateway/cases/audit/cursor_store (#6) —
    the manager never mints a per-source gateway or pipeline.
  * All children are gated on the SAME flags ``Poller._run`` checks
    (polling_enabled / setup_complete / not kill_switch / not demo_active); a burst of
    sources is bounded by ``caps.max_concurrent``; a per-cluster-signature in-flight
    guard stops the same signature being investigated twice in one tick.

The manager IS ``state.poller`` and proxies the external lifecycle contract
(``start()`` / ``stop()`` / ``poll_once(prefs)`` / ``_source`` / ``_attach``) to the
primary child (or, for ``poll_once``, aggregates across all children).
