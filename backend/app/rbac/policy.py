"""RBAC permission policy (Wave 1 / F2; Round-3 Wave-1 NIST ladder).

Permissions are MODELLED as data (a ``role -> resource -> [actions]`` matrix) and
ENFORCED in code (:func:`can`). The default matrix lives here; an operator can
override it via ``Preferences.rbac.roles`` (a deep, additive override — an absent
role/resource falls back to this default), ADD custom roles via
``Preferences.rbac.custom_roles`` (name/inherits/grants/denies), and REMOVE
permissions via ``Preferences.rbac.denies`` (deny-wins).

Semantics (the three back-compat modes are decided by the caller in ``deps.py``,
not here):

* auth DISABLED        → everything allowed (the no-auth "old version" default).
* auth ON, rbac OFF    → every authenticated user is treated as ``super_admin``.
* auth ON, rbac ON     → :func:`can` is consulted for every gated action.

A wildcard ``"*"`` action grants ALL actions on a resource (used for super_admin).
``super_admin`` is additionally hard-allowed in :func:`can` so a malformed
override (or an over-broad DENY) can never lock the platform's owner out.

Round-3 Wave-1 additions (ALL additive + defaulted → :func:`can` is byte-identical
to the prior matrix when no custom role / deny / resource override is configured):

* The thin ``settings`` vocabulary is SPLIT so each newer feature is its own
  narrow resource (``notifications``/``branding``/``sessions``/``demo``/
  ``terminology``/``automation``/``roles``/``models``/``enrichment``/``inapp``).
  The DEFAULT grants preserve current per-role behaviour: whoever can
  ``settings:manage`` today keeps equivalent ``manage`` access on the narrow
  resources, so migrating the route decorators changes nothing behaviourally.
* :func:`effective_matrix` folds CUSTOM roles (``name``/``inherits``/``grants``/
  ``denies``) with cycle-guarded inheritance, then applies explicit DENY with
  DENY-WINS precedence (evaluated AFTER allows).
* :func:`can_object` is an OPT-IN row/object scope hook with a WHITELISTED
  condition vocabulary (no ``eval``). It is OFF by default (defers to :func:`can`).

# A condition is a pure ``(user, obj, ctx) -> bool`` function registered in
# ``_OBJECT_CONDITIONS``. The per-role / per-resource binding ("which conditions apply")
# is read from the RBAC config's ``object_scope`` map when present; absent → no
# conditions → allow (defer to can()). Conditions are ANDed; an unknown condition name
# is treated as DENY (fail-closed for the row scope, since the operator asked to scope).
