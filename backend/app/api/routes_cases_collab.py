"""Per-case ticket COLLABORATION API (Round 3 / Wave 2, Feature 4).

A full ticket-style collaboration surface for ONE case, built over the Wave-1 KV
stores (``CaseThreadStore`` / ``CaseActivityStore`` / ``CaseTaskStore`` / ``InboxStore``)
plus the authoritative ``AuditLogger`` trail. It gives a case three friendly,
human-facing layers beside the immutable audit log (#2):

* **Thread** — threaded discussion where the AI is a FIRST-CLASS author
  (``author_type`` human | ai | system; one-level ``parent_id`` replies; emoji
  reactions; in-place edit + soft-delete tombstone — never a hard delete, #2). Every
  per-case ChatEngine turn is also persisted here (the chat engine extension), so the
  investigation reasoning stops being ephemeral. Legacy ``Case.comments`` are
  migrated-on-read into root thread messages (no schema break).
* **Activity** — an append-only who-did-what timeline assembled from the existing
  audit store UNIONed with the ``CaseActivityStore`` friendly feed.
* **Tasks** — a per-case checklist with an append-only log trail.

@mentions in a message body are resolved against the user store and fanned into each
mentioned user's inbox as an ``InAppNotification`` (category=mention).

NON-NEGOTIABLES upheld here:

* **#3** — NOTHING in this module touches ``case_manager.decide()`` / the close /
  escalate truth table. An AI or system message can RECOMMEND but can NEVER set a
  case's ``status`` / ``verdict`` / ``disposition`` (asserted by a test). The thread
  is advisory display data only.
* **#9** — every operator/AI-influenceable value (``body`` / ``mentions`` / task
  ``title`` / log ``note`` / reaction ``emoji``) is returned as PLAIN data; the UI
  escapes it. We never feed a thread body into a prompt unfenced (the chat engine
  fences its own context).
* **#2** — soft-delete tombstones (never hard-delete a message); every collaboration
  mutation is also recorded on the append-only audit trail.
* **#5** — the ONE chat engine is reused verbatim; this module only PERSISTS its
  turns onto the thread (no fork).

Endpoints (mounted by the integrator under the ``/api`` router):

    GET    /api/cases/{case_id}/activity
    GET    /api/cases/{case_id}/thread
    POST   /api/cases/{case_id}/thread
    PATCH  /api/cases/{case_id}/thread/{msg_id}
    DELETE /api/cases/{case_id}/thread/{msg_id}
    POST   /api/cases/{case_id}/thread/{msg_id}/reactions
    GET    /api/cases/{case_id}/tasks
    POST   /api/cases/{case_id}/tasks
    PATCH  /api/cases/{case_id}/tasks/{tid}
    POST   /api/cases/{case_id}/tasks/{tid}/log

All non-GET routes are gated on ``cases:comment`` (post/react) or ``cases:write``
(tasks) — existing ``cases`` RBAC actions; GET routes inherit ``require_auth`` from
the mount.
