/**
 * Co-located data layer for the cross-case CAMPAIGN surface (Round 4 / Wave 4).
 *
 * READ-ONLY views over the running campaign list the deterministic clustering pass
 * (`backend/app/engine/campaigns.py`) produces, plus a manual re-correlate trigger.
 * Endpoints (all under `/api`):
 *   GET  /campaigns                — the running campaign list (newest first).
 *   GET  /campaigns/{id}           — one campaign (404 when absent).
 *   GET  /cases/{id}/campaign      — the campaign a case belongs to (or null).
 *   POST /campaigns/recorrelate    — trigger the deterministic pass ON DEMAND (admin).
 *
 * We use the low-level `api.get/post` verbs from `@/lib/api` rather than adding methods
 * to the shared client, so this builder stays parallel-safe.
 *
 * ⛔ ADVISORY ONLY (#3/#4): a campaign is a presentation/reporting grouping — it NEVER
 * force-merges cases, recomputes a `cluster_signature`, closes/escalates a member
 * case, or feeds the deterministic `decide()`. A NEEDS_HUMAN case that joins a campaign
 * stays NEEDS_HUMAN. Re-correlate is a read-time aggregator.
 *
 * SECURITY (#9): every entity `value` / MITRE id / campaign name is source-derived
 * PLAIN data — the consuming components render it escaped (plain text / CodeBlock) and
 * it is never interpolated into a prompt. The types below describe the SHAPE only.
