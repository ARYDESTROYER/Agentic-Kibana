# Agentic SOC Console (`webui/`)

A self-hosted single-page app (Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS +
shadcn-style primitives on Radix UI — **not** `@elastic/eui`) for the
vendor-agnostic Agentic SOC API. This **is** the primary UI (the
legacy Kibana plugin is archived, see [`../archive/README.md`](../archive/README.md)):
the browser talks to the FastAPI backend **directly**, with no Kibana and no
in-Kibana proxy in the loop.

## What's here

- **First-run setup workspace** (`src/soc/pages/Wizard.tsx`) — a responsive
  **four-stage** on-ramp (deeper provider/model configuration lives in Settings):
  1. **Workspace** — choose a Live environment or an isolated Synthetic demo.
  2. **Data sources** — pick a connector from `GET /api/connectors` (grouped by
     category), render a dynamic form from its `auth_fields` + `config_fields` via
     the shared `SourceEditor` component, test the current draft, and save
     (secrets → `POST /api/sources/{id}/secrets`, config → `POST /api/sources`).
     Add multiple sources; mark one pull source primary. Leaving an open editor
     requires discard confirmation.
  3. **AI runtime** — Anthropic / OpenAI / embedding API keys only. They are
     write-only and auto-save when guarded navigation leaves the stage (at least
     one is recommended; without one, live investigations use the mock runtime).
     Azure / Bedrock / Vertex / OpenAI-compatible (local) keys and per-role model
     selection (router / investigator / formatter / standup / chat / overview /
     embedding, `GET /api/models`) are configured later from **Settings → Models**.
  4. **Review & launch** — truthful Ready / Needs attention / Optional states,
     default automation-posture explanation, then **Launch Agentic SOC** →
     `POST /api/setup/complete`.
  The wizard shows automatically when `GET /api/setup/status` reports
  `setup_complete: false`; setup-status failure is fail-closed and retryable. A
  non-destructive Settings re-run ends with **Apply changes**.
- **Sources manager** (`src/soc/pages/Sources.tsx`) — a standalone top-level page
  (Platform nav group; not nested inside Settings): a dense, sortable
  `<DataTable>` (search/filter/bulk-select/inline enable toggle/status/last-event
  via `GET /api/sources/health`) for listing, adding, editing, testing, and
  deleting sources and setting the primary — reusing the same `SourceEditor`
  (`src/soc/components/SourceEditor.tsx`) the wizard uses.
- **Settings** (`src/soc/pages/Settings.tsx` + `src/soc/pages/settings/*`) — the
  full `Preferences` surface, organized as a data-driven section registry
  (5 nav groups × 25 sections: account, general, integrations, security & access,
  organization), plus write-only secret management and a "Re-run setup wizard"
  button.
- **The rest of the console** — Cases/CaseDetail, Chat/Investigate (one chat
  engine, two entry points), Automated scans, Standup, Cost, Metrics, Campaigns,
  Baseline, Batch jobs, Detection & Rules, custom Dashboards, Knowledge (RAG),
  Memory, Playbooks, Notifications/Inbox, Audit log, Users/Roles, and more — all
  mature, shipped surfaces (not previews) that call their backend endpoints and
  render full result sets, not just basic scaffolding.

**`src/soc/registry.tsx`** (`FEATURES[]`) is the single source of truth for
navigation: it derives the left nav, the router, and the command palette from
one typed table, gated per-feature by RBAC. There is no separate hand-maintained
route list to keep in sync.

The reusable centerpiece for connector configuration is **`SourceEditor`**
(`src/soc/components/SourceEditor.tsx`): it turns an `AuthField[]` into a
validated form and returns a `{ config, secrets }` pair, so any SIEM/connector
the backend advertises is configurable with zero per-connector UI code.

## Authentication

Login, 6-role RBAC (+ operator-defined custom roles), MFA (TOTP), and OIDC SSO
are **built into this app** — not something you bring yourself. Auth is
**default OFF** (the no-auth "everyone is super_admin" mode is the out-of-the-box
experience); set `TLSOC_AUTH_ENABLED=true` on the backend to turn on the login
screen and enforce RBAC. See `SECURITY.md` for the full model.

## Develop

```bash
cd webui
npm install
npm run dev          # serves on http://localhost:5173, proxies /api -> :8088
```

Point the dev proxy at a different backend with `BACKEND_URL`:

```bash
BACKEND_URL=http://my-backend:8088 npm run dev
```

Run the backend in another terminal:

```bash
cd ../backend && . .venv/bin/activate && uvicorn app.main:app --port 8088
```

## Build

```bash
cd webui
npm run build        # tsc --noEmit (strict type check) + vite build -> dist/
npm run typecheck    # type check only
npm run preview      # preview the production build
```

The build emits a static `dist/` you can serve from any web server behind a
reverse proxy that forwards `/api` to the FastAPI backend.

## Test

```bash
cd webui
npm run test:strict   # unit/component tests; rejects stderr and captured console output
npm run lint -- --max-warnings=0
```

`npm run build` + `npm run test:strict` + zero-warning lint must all be clean before a
commit touching `webui/` (see `AGENTS.md` §7/§8).

## Production (Docker)

The container path bundles the build + an nginx that serves the SPA and
reverse-proxies the API — the browser only ever calls **relative** `/api/*` paths,
so it never needs to know the backend's address (no CORS, no Kibana proxy):

- **`webui/Dockerfile`** — multi-stage: `node:22-alpine` runs `npm ci` +
  `npm run build`, then `nginx:1.27-alpine` serves `dist/`.
- **`webui/nginx.conf`** — `location /api/` proxies to `http://tlsoc-backend:8088`
  (300s timeouts for long LLM investigations; a separate unbuffered
  `location /api/events` handles the live SSE stream); everything else falls back
  to `index.html` (SPA routing); hashed assets are long-cached, while
  `/release.json` and `/index.html` use no-store semantics.

The build emits `/release.json` with the immutable Console version, channel, commit,
and build time. On a supported, bootstrapped PostgreSQL Compose deployment, the top
bar may offer a newer Stable candidate. Mutable branch observation is discovery only:
confirmation stays blocked until the private update supervisor verifies the signed
release plan, digest-pinned images, compatibility, backup capacity, and local runtime
preconditions. Known unsaved drafts also block confirmation. The browser submits only
opaque release, preflight, and idempotency identifiers; it never receives Docker
authority, registry credentials, host paths, commands, Compose fragments, or image
references.

The supervisor owns pull, verified backup, backend/Web replacement, readiness and
identity checks, durable progress, and automatic in-flight rollback. After success,
the Console rechecks the manifest, backend identity/readiness, and `/index.html`
before reloading the current hash route. A compatibility fallback still activates a
healthy coherent pair that an external deployment system already installed. See
[`docs/operations/upgrades.md`](../docs/operations/upgrades.md) for the one-time
v0.1.1→v0.1.7 bootstrap, supported topology, lifecycle wrapper, and post-success
image-only rollback boundary.

The supported single-container supervisor cannot retain the previous Web container's
hashed assets: it force-recreates the service, so open tabs can briefly miss an old
lazy-loaded chunk before they accept the new release. Save drafts before updating and
reload on a chunk miss. Production sites that require uninterrupted old-asset serving
must use an operator-owned retained-artifact or blue-green deployment outside the
one-click profile.

The agnostic stack builds and runs this image as the `tlsoc-webui` service and
publishes it on **:8080**:

```bash
# from the repo root
./scripts/agentic-soc-compose.sh up -d --build
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

In production, terminate TLS at a reverse proxy in front of nginx. Application
auth (login/RBAC/MFA/SSO) is built in and optional (see above); see `SECURITY.md`
for the full threat model and hardening notes.

## Design system

The console shares one look end-to-end — reuse it rather than re-rolling styles:

- **Tokens**: `src/styles/theme.css` — CSS custom properties (dual light/dark),
  consumed through Tailwind. Semantic colors (severity/status/verdict) come from
  `src/soc/components/palette.ts`.
- **Primitives**: `src/ui/*` — shadcn-style wrappers over Radix UI (`button`,
  `card`, `dialog`, `select`, `tabs`, `table`, `tooltip`, `sheet`, …). Wrap them,
  don't fork them.
- **Cross-cutting catalog**: `src/design-system/*` — the public `LoadingState` /
  `LoadingGlyph` / `LoadingBar` feedback grammar, original theme-adaptive
  `SourceMark` assets, and the JSON-serializable `DESIGN_SYSTEM_CATALOG`. Import these from
  `@/design-system`; do not create page-local blocking loaders or source marks.
- **SOC-domain components**: `src/soc/components/*` — `PageContainer`,
  `PageHeader`, `KpiTile`/`StatCard`, `DataTable`, `EmptyState`, `RiskGauge`,
  `Can` (the RBAC guard), `ChatPanel`, and more.

The catalog is a future MCP/tooling input only; version 0.1.7 does not claim or ship
a design-system MCP server. See `docs/development/design-system.md` and `AGENTS.md`
§8 for the full contract.

## Notes

- No Kibana / `@kbn/*` imports — this is a fully standalone npm project, so new
  dependencies are a deliberate decision, not a constraint imposed by a host
  plugin (unlike the archived Kibana plugin).
- Theming: `src/soc/theme.tsx` (`ThemeProvider`/`useTheme`) drives Tailwind's
  dark-mode class + the CSS-variable tokens; a header toggle switches
  light/dark/system at runtime.
- The typed API client (`src/lib/api.ts`) centralizes error handling: non-2xx
  responses become `ApiError` carrying the backend's `detail`.
