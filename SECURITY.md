# SECURITY.md — Threat model & security posture

This document describes the security posture of the **Agentic SOC Triage Suite** —
a vendor-agnostic, LLM-driven SOC triage tool that runs **next to** your existing
security telemetry as a **read-only consumer**. Because the suite reads
attacker-influenced event data (from any source) and drives Large Language Models
with it, its design treats every external surface as hostile and makes its safety
guarantees **deterministic code**, not model behaviour.

Every claim below is enforced somewhere in the tree; the enforcement point is cited
inline. See also the 12 non-negotiables in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) §5,
[`README.md`](README.md), and [`docs/RUNBOOK.md`](docs/RUNBOOK.md) (rotation).

> invalidation, and idle/absolute/refresh **token policy**
> (`Preferences.session_policy`); refresh-token rotation with reuse (theft)

> templates (`notifications/templates.py`); and a **CI-verified** RBAC gate
> (`tests/test_route_auth_coverage.py` fails if any non-GET `/api` route lacks an

> **19 enrichment providers** (§7) replaced the original 2; fine-grained **custom

> **Round 9**: an optional **local/self-hosted LLM provider**

## 1. Trust boundaries

The suite spans these tiers. Each arrow crosses a trust boundary; the suite
**never** holds a write credential to any log source, and **never** uses a source's
superuser/admin credential at runtime.

| # | Boundary | Posture |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | Analyst browser ↔ web UI | The standalone SPA should sit **behind a TLS reverse proxy** with your own auth (the SPA itself is a thin viewer). The UI sees **booleans only** for secrets (`configured ✓`), never values (`config.py:configured_status`). |
| 2 | Web UI ↔ backend | The browser calls **relative** `/api/*` paths; nginx reverse-proxies them to `tlsoc-backend:8088` server-side (`webui/nginx.conf`). The browser bundle contains **no** backend URL or secret (no CORS, no embedded host). |
| 3 | Backend ↔ sources / state / LLM / enrichment | Per-source **read-only** credentials for every log source; a single least-privilege credential for the chosen state backend; outbound HTTPS to LLM/enrichment. **All inbound event data is treated as UNTRUSTED** (§4). |

## 2. Read-only, scoped source credentials (generalised principle #1)

The #1 non-negotiable — *a read-only, scoped credential for the agent's log
access* — now applies to **every** connector, not just Elasticsearch:

- **Pull connectors** (Elasticsearch / OpenSearch / Wazuh, future SIEMs) require a
  **read-only** API key/token scoped to the log index/pattern. The Elastic
  connector's manifest spells this out: *"a READ-ONLY API key scoped to the log
  index pattern only (never kibana_system or the elastic superuser)"*
  (`connectors/elastic.py`). The agent's `es_query`/search tools read only — they
  never write a source, and the prompts state the agent can ONLY read data.
- **Push receivers** never hold a source credential at all — the source authenticates
  **to us** (§3.1); the suite has no write path back to the source.

**ES state backend (default) keeps the two-key split.** When `STATE_BACKEND` is
`elasticsearch`, the suite still uses **two physically separate least-privilege
keys** for ES (`es/client.py` `_ro` + `_mgmt`): a read-only key for `all-logs-*`
and a management key for `tlsoc-agent-*`. Neither is `kibana_system` nor the
`elastic` superuser; a missing key yields a clear error, never a silent fallback to
a write credential.

| Key (env var) | Scope | Privileges |
|---|---|---|
| `ES_API_KEY` (read-only log source) | the log index pattern | `read`, `view_index_metadata` |
| `ES_MGMT_API_KEY` (ES state backend only) | `tlsoc-agent-*` | `read`, `write`, `create_index`, `view_index_metadata`, `manage` |

> A source's superuser/admin credential is used by an operator **once**, to mint
> the read-only key, then never at runtime (non-negotiable #1).

**Connection-test + log-browse stay within the read-only scope.** A pull source's
"Test connection" (`POST /api/connectors/test`) and the per-source **log browse**
(`GET /api/sources/{id}/logs`) both exercise only the **scoped, read-only search** —
the test no longer requires `cluster_monitor`/`ping()`, so a least-privilege
read-only key suffices and nothing needs a broader credential. The browse endpoint
is **auth-protected** (subject to the optional API-auth gate below) and returns
**log data only** — its rows (`ts`/`source_ip`/`user`/`host`/`rule`/`severity`/
`message`/`_raw`) are read from the source via the **per-source read-only ES
client** (honoring that source's `es_verify_certs`/`es_ca_cert`), are **bounded**
(pull: hard-cap 200; push: an in-memory ≤500/source live-tail buffer), and **never
include secret values**. The returned `_raw` document and every field are
attacker-influenceable, so the webui renders them strictly as plain text via
`CodeBlock`/`InlineCode` (`webui/src/soc/components/CodeBlock.tsx`), never
`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (non-negotiable #9).

## 3. Secrets handling

| Property | Behaviour | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Source | **Environment / `.env`** for global keys; the **secret tier** for runtime/wizard-pushed and per-source values. | `config.py:Secrets` (`SettingsConfigDict(env_file=".env")`) |
| UI exposure | The UI sees **booleans only** (`configured ✓`); secret **values are never returned**. | `config.py:configured_status`; `routes.py` `/setup/status`, `/settings`, `/models` |
| Wizard-pushed global keys | Kept **in process memory only — lost on backend restart** (`state.apply_secrets`); `.env` is the durable path. | `routes.py:setup_secrets` |
| Clearing a key | An explicit `null` **revokes** a key (`exclude_unset`, not `exclude_none`). | `routes.py:setup_secrets` |
| Never persisted | Nothing secret is written to the **state store**, to **git**, or to **logs**. | `config.py` docstring |

### 3.1 Per-source secrets (the secret tier)

A source's secrets — a pull connector's read-only key, a webhook **bearer token**,
an **HMAC shared secret**, a cloud/broker credential — go to a dedicated
**in-memory secret tier** keyed by source id (`Secrets.connector_secrets`,
`set_source_secret`). They are **never persisted** to Preferences or any state
store; only the configured field **names** are recorded on the source
(`SourceInstance.configured_secrets`) and shown in the UI as configured-only
(non-negotiable #10). `POST /api/sources/{id}/secrets` sets/clears them; an empty
value revokes. Because they are in-memory, they must be re-set after a backend
restart (or supplied via env).

> Roadmap: an optional persisted **encrypted** secret store so wizard/per-source
> keys survive a restart. Until then, set durable secrets in `.env`.

## 4. Prompt-injection posture: inbound events are untrusted

All event data is **attacker-influenceable** — and with push receivers, an attacker
may even **POST directly** to an ingest endpoint. The suite treats every
event-derived value as **UNTRUSTED DATA** in prompts:

- Every event normalises to **OCSF** first (`ocsf/`). Whatever a connector cannot
  map deterministically lands in the first-class **`unmapped`** catch-all, and the
  original source record is kept in **`raw_data`** for audit/repro
  (`ocsf/model.py`). **Both `unmapped` and `raw_data` are attacker-influenceable**
  and are treated as untrusted data exactly like any mapped field.
- Every value placed in a prompt is wrapped in labelled, delimited fences
  `<<<UNTRUSTED_LOG_DATA>>> … <<<END_UNTRUSTED_LOG_DATA>>>`
  (`constants.UNTRUSTED_OPEN`/`CLOSE`) via `fence()` in `agents/prompts.py`.
- **Every** system prompt carries the security note telling the model to treat
  fenced content strictly as DATA and **never** follow instructions, URLs, or
  commands inside the fences (`prompts._INJECTION_NOTE`).
- Fencing applies to **everything attacker-influenceable**: entity values, rule
  names, sample event JSON (including `unmapped`/`raw_data`), enrichment, standup
  aggregate keys, and — for chat — screen-context, selection, and query inputs
  (non-negotiable #9).

### 4.1 Inbound push authentication

Push receivers authenticate the sender before parsing a single byte
(`connectors/receivers/webhook.py`, `verify_auth`):

- **`bearer`** — requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (also accepts `Splunk
  <token>` / a bare token) to equal the source's `token` secret, compared with
  **`hmac.compare_digest`** (constant-time) to avoid timing oracles. An unset token
  rejects everything.
- **`hmac`** — requires a hex **HMAC-SHA256 of the exact request body** in the
  configured `signature_header` (a `sha256=` prefix is tolerated), keyed by the
  source's `shared_secret`, again compared constant-time.
- **`none`** — accepts anything reachable; use **only** behind a trusted proxy.

A failed check raises `PermissionError`, mapped to **HTTP 401** by the route; the
secret never leaves the secret tier. Parsing of an authenticated body never raises
(malformed bodies become best-effort events) — but the parsed content is still
fenced as untrusted (§4).

### 4.2 The model never auto-acts

The verdict is **advisory only**; the consequential decision is deterministic code:

- The **verdict** (`TRUE_POSITIVE`/`FALSE_POSITIVE`/`NEEDS_HUMAN`) is an LLM
  *recommendation* (`constants.Verdict`).
- The **close/escalate decision** is a pure function, `decide()`, in
  `engine/case_manager.py`, over `(verdict, confidence, risk_score, policy)` —
  never raw LLM output, never playbook text.
- **Only `NEEDS_HUMAN` (or a missing verdict) is the code-enforced,
  non-tunable never-auto-close case.** `CaseManager.apply()` carries a
  defence-in-depth assertion that raises if anything tries to close one:
  `AssertionError("Invariant violated: attempted to auto-close a NEEDS_HUMAN
  case")`. This guard protects `NEEDS_HUMAN`, not `TRUE_POSITIVE` (see below).
- **FALSE_POSITIVE auto-close is ON by default.** The live `AutoClosePolicy`
  (`config.py`, `Preferences.auto_close`) auto-closes a FALSE_POSITIVE when
  `false_positive.enabled` (default **true**) AND `confidence >=
  min_confidence` (default **0.85**) AND `risk_score <= max_risk_score`
  (default **30**), then only with an `objection_window_minutes` (default
  **1440**, i.e. 24h) during which a human can reopen it. This is the live
  knob — the deprecated `FpAutoCloseConfig` is migrated forward into it
  automatically for old persisted preferences.
- **TRUE_POSITIVE auto-close is a real, opt-in policy knob — OFF by
  default**, not "never." An operator can enable
  `auto_close.true_positive` (default `enabled=false`, `min_confidence=0.95`,
  `max_risk_score=10`, `objection_window_minutes=4320`); while disabled (the
  default), every TRUE_POSITIVE routes to a human. Unlike `NEEDS_HUMAN`, there
  is no code-level ban on auto-closing a TRUE_POSITIVE — the protection is a
  conservative default-off *policy*, tunable by an operator who accepts the
  trade-off.
- Anything else — `NEEDS_HUMAN`, a missing verdict, or any LLM/source/tool failure —
  **fails safe to a human**: an alert is never dropped.

### 4.3 TRUSTED operator context (memory + RAG) — informs, never decides

**Agent memory** (durable operator facts, `stores/memory.py`) is injected as
**TRUSTED** context in a `<<<MEMORY>>>` block, distinct from the fenced
UNTRUSTED evidence. RAG knowledge is **not** uniformly trusted — it is split by
an explicit, default-deny allowlist:

- **The TRUSTED-knowledge allowlist is `runbook` / `mitre` / `suppression`
  ONLY** (`tools/rag.py:TRUSTED_KNOWLEDGE_SOURCES`, `is_trusted_knowledge()`) —
  the system-verified seed corpus: shipped operator runbooks, the bundled
  MITRE ATT&CK technique descriptions, and the suite's own suppression
  guidance. These are rendered as TRUSTED reference material because they are
  authored/verified by the system, not reachable by an attacker or an
  arbitrary operator upload.
- **Everything else retrieved by RAG is UNTRUSTED and fenced exactly like log
  evidence**, including operator-**imported** documents (`source="imported"`,
  `RagService.import_document`) and **resolved-case** text
  (`source="resolved_case"`, prior-case baselines/notes) — both are
  default-deny under the allowlist and wrapped in the same
  `<<<UNTRUSTED_...>>>` fences (§4) before reaching a prompt. This closes an
  **OWASP LLM01** (prompt-injection) gap: an operator-imported threat-intel
  document, or text an attacker can influence via a prior case's notes,
  cannot smuggle instructions into the model as "trusted" text.
- **They inform the LLM only; they can NEVER override the deterministic Case
  Manager.** Memory and TRUSTED knowledge can shape the model's *verdict
  recommendation*, but the consequential close/escalate decision is still the
  pure function in `engine/case_manager.py:decide` (§4.2, non-negotiable #3).
  No operator fact and no retrieved snippet — trusted or not — can auto-close
  a case.
- **Precedence is fixed and explicit:** `policy > base-prompt > playbook >
  MEMORY > untrusted`. TRUSTED knowledge sits above the fenced UNTRUSTED
  evidence but below the immutable policy/base prompt.
- **Forged TRUSTED markers in event data are neutralised.** `fence()` in
  `agents/prompts.py` escapes any attacker-planted `<<<MEMORY>>>` (and
  `<<<PLAYBOOK>>>`) markers in log-derived data, so untrusted content cannot
  smuggle itself into a TRUSTED block.
- **Provenance is preserved.** Memory carries its `source` (`human` for
  explicit REST edits, `agent` for chat "remember:" actions — which only
  store user-directed text and are audited); agent-authored memory text and
  UNTRUSTED RAG chunk text are rendered in the UI as plain text via
  `CodeBlock`/`InlineCode` (never `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`), so a poisoned
  fact/snippet cannot inject markup into the analyst's browser
  (non-negotiable #9). The `/api/cases/{id}/rationale` "Why" view surfaces
  exactly which memory/knowledge a case used and presents the
  **deterministic** decision rationale prominently.

## 5. Read-only guarantee, audit, cost ledger, caps & kill switch

| Control | Guarantee | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Read-only sources | The suite **never writes to a log source**. Pull tools read only; push receivers have no write path back. | `connectors/*`, `tools/es_query.py`, `prompts.INVESTIGATOR_SYSTEM` |
| Audit trail (append-only) | Every agent action is audited, append-only. Action types: prompt, es_query, tool_call, context, verdict, decision, error, poll, scan (+ explicit memory edits). | `audit/audit_log.py`, `constants.ActionType` |
| Cost ledger | **100% of LLM calls** flow through one gateway, which writes a usage/cost row for **every** call (including failures, `outcome=error`). | `llm/gateway.py`; non-negotiable #6 |
| Per-case caps | `max_tool_calls` (8), `max_tokens` (20000), `timeout_seconds` (120). | `config.CapsConfig` |
| Kill switch | A global `caps.kill_switch` stops all investigations; polling is not (re)started while set. | `config.CapsConfig.kill_switch`; `routes.put_settings` |
| Cost gate | Runs **before** the expensive model so cheap/benign clusters never reach the strong investigator. | `engine/cost_gate.py` |

## 6. State-backend security

The suite's own state (cases/audit/usage/config/cursor/RAG) lives in the
`STATE_BACKEND` you choose — secure it like any datastore:

- **Postgres** — supply the async URL via `STATE_DB_URL` with a **dedicated,
  least-privilege role** (it needs DML + `CREATE EXTENSION vector` only the first
  time). Keep the credential in `.env`/the container env, never in the SPA. Place
  Postgres on an **internal network** (the agnostic compose does not publish 5432);
  use TLS for any cross-host connection. Back it up (`docs/RUNBOOK.md` §2.1).
- **SQLite** — a local file; protect it with filesystem permissions on a persistent
  volume. Fine for single-node; no network exposure.
- **Elasticsearch** — the management key is scoped to `tlsoc-agent-*` and can never
  read the log surface (§2); use TLS and verify certs.

Nothing secret is ever written to any of these — they hold **non-secret**
preferences and operational data only.

## 7. Data handling / privacy

**What is sent to the LLM.** Only **fenced, compact** OCSF fields and computed
context — never raw event dumps. The investigator prompt sends a deterministic
context block plus up to ~12 compacted sample events and any enrichment, all
fenced (`prompts.render_cluster`). The standup writer gets a **pre-aggregated**
JSON summary only — aggregate-then-summarise, never raw logs to a model
(non-negotiable #7).

**Enrichment egress.** When enabled, the suite sends **IPs/indicators** to one or
more of **19 registered providers** across 17 files (`enrichment/providers/`,
dispatched via `enrichment/dispatch.py` and the `tools/enrich.py` tool):
AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal, GreyNoise, Shodan, Shodan InternetDB, Censys, BinaryEdge,
IPinfo, OTX, Pulsedive, Spur, XForce, URLScan, HIBP, ProjectHoneypot, RDAP,
URLhaus, ThreatFox, and MalwareBazaar. Every call is Redis-cached to protect
free-tier limits and reduce egress (non-negotiable #8). Each provider is
independently toggleable; several **keyless** ones (Shodan InternetDB, IPinfo,
the abuse.ch trio, RDAP) default ON, the rest are opt-in per-key. GeoIP already
present in the event is read as-is (no egress).

**Running fully local.** The single LLM gateway is the abstraction seam: a
local/self-hosted model server (LiteLLM / vLLM / Ollama / LM Studio) registers as
an `openai_compatible` provider behind `llm/gateway.py` with no caller change —
either supply a `litellm_api_key` (env `LITELLM_API_KEY`, or push one at runtime
via `POST /api/llm/models/custom`) or omit it for a no-auth local endpoint driven
by `base_url` alone. Disabling enrichment removes all provider egress. Together
these let a deployment run with **no third-party network egress at all**.

## 8. Responsible disclosure

To report a security issue, contact the maintainers privately (do **not** open a
public issue with exploit detail). Include: affected component (web UI / backend /
connector / deploy), version (`/api/health` reports `version`), and reproduction
steps. We aim to acknowledge promptly and coordinate a fix before public
disclosure.

## 9. Hardening checklist (deploy-time)

- [ ] **TLS reverse proxy in front of the web UI**, with your own authentication —
      the SPA is a thin viewer and ships no auth of its own. Terminate TLS at the
      proxy; the SPA → backend hop stays on the internal network.
- [ ] **Read-only, scoped credential for every log source.** No source superuser at
      runtime; pull keys read-only and pattern-scoped. Verify push receivers have no
      write path back.
- [ ] **ES state backend: two scoped keys only** (read-only log key + mgmt
      `tlsoc-agent-*` key); verify the mgmt key cannot read `all-logs-*`.
- [ ] **State backend hardened** — Postgres on an internal network with a
      least-privilege role; SQLite file permissions; backups configured (§6).
- [ ] **Inbound push auth on.** Set `auth_mode` to `bearer` or `hmac` (never `none`
      on an exposed endpoint); set the per-source `token`/`shared_secret`.
- [ ] **Network egress allowlist for the backend.** Restrict outbound to exactly the
      configured LLM + enrichment endpoints (or a local vLLM gateway). Without LLM
      egress, investigations fail safe to NEEDS_HUMAN — never dropped.
- [ ] **Key rotation.** Rotate source/LLM/enrichment keys via `.env` + backend
      restart (durable) — wizard / per-source pushes are in-memory only
      (`docs/RUNBOOK.md` §4.1).
- [ ] **`read_only_settings_mode=true`** to freeze Settings after configuration.
- [ ] **No secrets in git / state store.** Confirm `.env` is git-ignored and that
      nothing secret lands in preferences or the state store.
- [ ] **Caps + kill switch reachable** from Settings.

## API authentication, RBAC, MFA & SSO

API auth ships **disabled by default** — the no-auth deployment (the original
model, where the network/reverse-proxy is the trust boundary) remains fully
supported and behaviourally unchanged out of the box. Enabling it
(`TLSOC_AUTH_ENABLED=true`) turns on a **login screen, persisted multi-user
accounts, 6-role RBAC, MFA (TOTP), and SSO (OIDC)**. Deploy steps + IdP redirect
URIs are in `DEPLOY.md` §9; a guided demo is in `DEMO.md`.

```bash
TLSOC_AUTH_ENABLED=true
TLSOC_AUTH_JWT_SECRET=<32+ random bytes>     # stable secret (else ephemeral, sessions die on restart)
TLSOC_AUTH_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
TLSOC_AUTH_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<plaintext, hashed in memory at startup, never stored>
# or a multi-user map of username -> PBKDF2 hash:
# TLSOC_AUTH_USERS={"alice":"pbkdf2_sha256$...","bob":"pbkdf2_sha256$..."}
TLSOC_AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=true                # REQUIRED behind TLS (HTTPS-only cookie)
```

When enabled, every `/api/*` route requires a valid session **except** the tiny
public allowlist (`/api/health`, `/api/auth/{login,me,logout}`, the SSO
authorize/callback) and the self-authenticating `/api/ingest/<source>` receivers.
Deny-by-default is enforced by a router-level dependency and a CI test
(`tests/test_route_auth_coverage.py`) that fails if any route slips the gate. The
webui shows a login screen and gates the app automatically (it is a strict no-op
when auth is off).

### First-run seed (OOBE)

When auth is enabled **and the user store is empty**, the backend auto-seeds a
demo **super_admin**: **`Admin` / `Admin@123`** (`config.auth_seed_admin*`). It
exists only to make a fresh, auth-on deployment usable — **change it
immediately** (create real accounts, then delete/disable the seed). The store
blocks removing the **last** active super_admin to prevent lockout
(`stores/users.py:count_active_super_admins`).

### RBAC — 6 roles + permission matrix

Accounts are persisted (a KV-doc in the state store — no new index/table). Each
user has exactly one role: `super_admin` · `soc_manager` · `analyst_tier2` ·
`analyst_tier1` · `responder` · `auditor`. Every privileged `/api` route is gated
by a `require_permission` dependency against the permission matrix (server-side,
deny-by-default); the webui mirrors it with `<Can>` guards purely for UX. When
auth is **OFF**, every authenticated principal is treated as `super_admin` for
back-compat with the original single-admin deployment.

### MFA (TOTP)

Per-user, opt-in **RFC-6238 TOTP** (verified against the official RFC test
vectors), enrolled from the UI with a **browser-rendered inline-SVG QR** (no
external QR service / no egress) and **single-use recovery codes**; login is
two-phase (password → 6-digit code).

> **Hardening TODO — MFA secret at rest.** The per-user TOTP seed is stored
> **obfuscated** with `Secrets.mfa_server_key()` (`TLSOC_MFA_OBFUSCATION_KEY`, or
> derived from the JWT secret when blank) — this is stdlib **obfuscation, not a
> KMS/HSM-backed envelope encryption** (`auth/mfa.py`). Treat the obfuscation key
> (and the JWT secret it can derive from) as sensitive, and prefer a future
> KMS-backed secret store. Recovery codes are single-use and stored hashed.

### SSO (OIDC — Google / Microsoft / generic)

Providers are configured in Settings (issuer, client id, group→role mapping);
the **client secret stays in the SECRET tier** (`Secrets.sso_client_secrets`, env
`TLSOC_SSO_CLIENT_SECRETS` or runtime `POST /api/auth/sso/providers/{id}/secret`,
never the config store). Login uses **server-side authorization-code exchange +
the userinfo endpoint**, with `state`/`nonce` for CSRF/replay defence; IdP groups
are provisioned onto the 6 roles. Register the redirect URI
`<base-url>/api/auth/sso/callback` with the IdP (`DEPLOY.md` §9.5).

> **Hardening TODO — id_token signature verification.** To avoid adding a
> JWKS/JWT-verify dependency, the current flow trusts the **server-side
> code-exchange + userinfo** result over TLS rather than independently verifying
> the `id_token`'s signature. This is safe given the confidential-client,
> back-channel exchange, but a JWKS-based `id_token` signature + `aud`/`iss`/`nonce`
> verification is a planned hardening step.

### Sessions, revocation & the token-version model

A valid JWT signature is necessary but **no longer sufficient** when auth is on. On
login the suite mints a short-lived **access token** carrying a 128-bit `sid` and a
per-user `token_version` (`tv`) claim, and registers a row in a backend-agnostic
**`SessionStore`** (`stores/sessions.py`, a KV doc in the chosen state backend — no
new index/table). `require_auth` (`api/deps.py`) does an **async** session check
**after** the sync, I/O-free `verify()`: it loads the session by `sid` and rejects
the request when the session is **missing, revoked, `tv`-stale, idle-expired**
(`now > last_active + idle_timeout`), or **absolute-expired** (`now > created_at +
absolute_lifetime`), bumping `last_active` lazily. The lifetimes are the
operator-tunable `session_policy` block (`DEPLOY.md` §9.4); they only **add**
revocation/expiry semantics on top of the JWT signature, never weaken it.

- **Revocation is real and immediate.** Revoking a single `sid`
  (`POST /api/sessions/{sid}/revoke`, or admin `POST
  /api/admin/sessions/{sid}/revoke`) marks the row revoked with `revoked_by` /
  `revoke_reason`; the next request on that token 401s. **Revoke-all** for a user
  (`POST /api/admin/users/{username}/revoke-all`, and the
  `/api/sessions/revoke-others` self-service) **bumps the user's `token_version`**,
  so *every* still-valid JWT carrying the old `tv` is rejected at once — a global
  sign-out with no need to wait for the access token's `exp`. Logout revokes the
  current `sid`. Every session create / revoke is **audited** (non-negotiable #2).
- **Step-up (`require_fresh_auth`).** Sensitive operations can require a recent
  authentication; a request whose `last_authn` is older than `sudo_reauth_window`
  401s with `{code:'reauth_required'}`, prompting a re-auth (`POST /api/auth/reauth`,
  which re-stamps `last_authn`).
- **Survives restart, dies on secret loss.** Sessions are persisted, so they outlive
  a backend restart and the internal `_wire()` rebuild — **provided
  `TLSOC_AUTH_JWT_SECRET` is stable**. An ephemeral JWT secret still invalidates
  every token on restart (the session rows load, but their JWTs no longer verify);
  set a stable secret in `.env`.
- **No-auth is unchanged.** When auth is OFF the whole session/step-up path is a
  strict no-op (every principal is treated as `super_admin`, as before).

### Refresh-token rotation & reuse (theft) detection

`POST /api/auth/refresh` rotates the refresh token on every use: the presented token
is matched against the session's stored **hash** (refresh tokens are stored
**hashed**, never plaintext), a new token is minted, and the old hash is demoted to
`refresh_prev_hash`. If a token is presented that matches an **already-rotated
`refresh_prev_hash`**, that is treated as **theft** (a replay of a token that should
have been discarded): the suite immediately **revokes every session for the user and
bumps their `token_version`** (`revoke_all(..., reason="refresh_reuse_detected")`),
audits a `refresh_reuse` event, best-effort notifies, and 401s. This bounds the
damage of a leaked refresh token to a single use before the whole account's sessions
are nuked.

### Demo Mode isolation guarantees

Demo Mode (`DEPLOY.md` §11.1) is **admin-gated** and engineered so synthetic data
can **never** contaminate, cost, or alter a real deployment:

- **Separate store.** Demo events flow through the *real* pipeline for fidelity, but
  every demo write lands in a **throwaway in-memory store** built per-enable and
  GC'd on disable, tagged with a unique `run_id`. A **write-guard** (`state.py`
  `_write_guard`) asserts that a demo-tagged row only ever reaches the demo store and
  a real row only ever reaches the real store — a mismatch raises, so the two can
  never cross.
- **Zero cost, deterministic.** While demo is active the LLM gateway uses a
  deterministic **mock provider**; usage rows are `pricing_source='zero'` (the cost
  page shows "(simulated)"), so a demo never spends a real token or hits a provider.
- **The deterministic gate still rules (#3).** FP cases still run through the real
  `engine/case_manager.decide()` against a **sandboxed `AutoClosePolicy` copy** — the
  live policy is untouched and #3 is byte-identical; NEEDS_HUMAN stays open as an
  HITL showcase.
- **Real source untouched, fully reversible.** Demo gating happens **before** the
  real `source.poll`, so the durable polling cursor (#4) is never advanced or
  corrupted. `POST /api/demo/disable` **hard-deletes** all demo data by `run_id`
  (cases/audit/usage/events) and flips the tenant back to `off` in one reversible
  step.

### Email-notification rendering: escaping & header-safety

The 5 built-in (operator-overridable) email templates render through a tiny stdlib
mustache-subset engine (`notifications/templates.py`) designed so a case field an
attacker can influence (rule name, entity, message) can never break out of the
email — the rendered body is still attacker-influenceable **data**:

- **Auto-escaped by default.** `{{var}}` interpolations pass through `html.escape`,
  so injected markup renders as inert text. The unescaped `{{{var}}}` form exists
  **only** for trusted, operator-authored header HTML, never for case-derived values.
- **Header-injection safe.** The Subject and every email header value go through
  `header_safe()` (strips CR/LF + control chars, length-capped), closing the classic
  CRLF header-injection vector; the synthetic `Message-Id` / threading headers are
  deterministic and case-derived. Untrusted vars in the plain-text part go through
  `text_safe()` (newlines stripped).
- **Channel isolation (#3).** A channel's `send()` never raises and never blocks or
  alters triage — delivery is fire-and-forget **after** the case is saved, so a
  failing email cannot change a case's status. The channel **secret** (SMTP password
  / SES IAM secret / Resend API key) stays in the SECRET tier and never appears in
  the audited `SendResult.detail`.

### Hardening notes (middleware)

- Set `TLSOC_AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=true` in production (TLS); the session cookie is
  always `HttpOnly` + `SameSite=Lax`.
- Passwords are hashed with **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** (`auth/passwords.py`). The
  iteration count is a fixed default — **review/raise it** (and migrate hashes) as
  hardware improves; consider a memory-hard KDF (argon2/scrypt) for a hardened
  profile.
- Security headers (CSP/HSTS/nosniff/frame-deny) are on by default. The Redis-free
  in-process **rate limiter** (`TLSOC_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED`, default **off**) and
  **CSRF** (`TLSOC_CSRF_ENABLED`, default **off**) are opt-in.
- `csrf_enabled` currently expects API clients to send `X-CSRF-Token` matching a
  `tlsoc_csrf` cookie; the standalone webui does not yet issue/echo that token, so
  enable CSRF only for header-setting API clients (or after wiring the webui).
  `SameSite=Lax` already blocks the common cross-site POST CSRF vector.
- The rate limiter only trusts `X-Forwarded-For` when constructed with
  `trust_forwarded_for=True` (behind a known proxy); otherwise it keys on the
  socket peer to prevent header-spoofed bucket rotation.

### Notification-channel secrets

Notification delivery (email via SMTP / SES / Resend, Slack/Teams/webhook/
PagerDuty/Telegram) keeps each channel's credential (SMTP password, SES IAM secret,
Resend API key, webhook URL, or API token) in the **SECRET tier**
(`Secrets.notification_secrets`, env `TLSOC_NOTIFICATION_SECRETS` or runtime
`POST /api/notifications/channels/{id}/secret`) — never the config store; the UI
shows `configured ✓` only. Channels fire **fire-and-forget after** a case is
saved, so a failing/slow channel never blocks or alters triage, and a
notification **cannot change a case's status** (non-negotiable #3 is untouched).
