# Quickstart

Use the deterministic demo to explore the analyst workflow without an external
source or provider bill. Use the Compose stack when you are ready to evaluate a
real source with persistent application state.

!!! info "Choose the matching channel"

    `Testing` contains integrated candidates. Under the release contract, `main`
    holds only accepted Stable source and immutable `v0.1.8` identifies this patch.
    The remote has both canonical branches; use `v0.1.8` only when its signed GitHub
    Release and public digest-pinned images verify, and use `Testing` only for an unreleased preview;
    repository administrators must verify branch protections and required checks
    independently. Never use `v0.1.4` or `v0.1.5`: those immutable
    failed-publication records do not have a canonical signed plan and public
    GitHub Release. Never bootstrap from `v0.1.6` either: its signed/public artifact
    set is valid, but canonical macOS Bash 3.2 acceptance failed before supervisor
    installation. It is immutable, superseded history.

## Get the source

=== "Testing"

    ```bash
    git clone --branch Testing --depth 1 \
      https://github.com/ARYDESTROYER/Agentic-Kibana.git
    cd Agentic-Kibana
    ```

=== "Stable 0.1.8"

    ```bash
    git clone --branch v0.1.8 --depth 1 \
      https://github.com/ARYDESTROYER/Agentic-Kibana.git
    cd Agentic-Kibana
    ```

    The `v0.1.8` tag is immutable after publication; do not create, move, or replace it locally. Users
    pulling `main` receive the current accepted Stable source, while candidate work
    remains isolated on `Testing`. A branch name alone is not acceptance evidence,
    so repository administrators must verify protections and required checks. If the
    signed Release or public image evidence is missing, use a previously verified Stable release.

## Option A: deterministic demo

The demo uses generated multi-source security stories and a deterministic `$0`
mock model. It exercises the real parsing, OCSF, correlation, case, and audit paths
without contacting a model provider or upstream security system.

### Requirements

- Python 3.11
- Node.js 22 and npm
- macOS or Linux with Bash

```bash
./scripts/run-demo.sh
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173` and sign in with the demo-only account printed by the
script. In the standard seed it is `Admin` / `Admin@123`. Stop both processes with
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.

!!! warning "Demo credentials are not deployment credentials"

    Never expose the demo account or reuse its password with real data. Demo Mode
    isolates triage and forces the mock provider, but organization settings you
    deliberately change remain real configuration.

Continue with [Demo Mode](demo.md) for story generation, seeded mode, and reset
behaviour, or [Your first case](first-case.md) for the analyst walkthrough.

## Option B: standalone stack

The standalone deployment contains PostgreSQL + pgvector for Agentic SOC state, Redis
for enrichment caching, the FastAPI backend, and the nginx-served Agentic SOC Console.
Your SIEM or event source is connected separately and is not modified.

### Requirements

- Docker Engine or Docker Desktop
- Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose`)
- an Anthropic/OpenAI key or a reachable OpenAI-compatible model, unless you keep
  triage in Demo Mode
- a least-privilege read-only credential for each pull source

### Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set unique values for the database password, JWT signing secret, and first admin:

```dotenv
TLSOC_PG_PASSWORD=<random-database-password>
TLSOC_AUTH_ENABLED=true
TLSOC_AUTH_JWT_SECRET=<stable-random-secret-at-least-32-bytes>
TLSOC_AUTH_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
TLSOC_AUTH_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<unique-admin-password>

# Configure one provider, or register a compatible local model after setup.
TLSOC_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
TLSOC_OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

Generate random values with `openssl rand -hex 32`. Do not commit `.env`. Set
`TLSOC_AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=true` when TLS terminates in front of the console.

### Validate and start

```bash
./scripts/agentic-soc-compose.sh config --quiet
./scripts/agentic-soc-compose.sh up --detach --build
./scripts/agentic-soc-compose.sh ps
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`, then verify the public probes:

```bash
curl --fail http://localhost:8080/api/health/live
curl --fail http://localhost:8080/api/health/ready
curl --fail http://localhost:8080/api/health/build-info
```

- **Live** confirms the API process is running.
- **Ready** confirms the configured application-state store is usable; an
  unavailable dependency returns HTTP `503`.
- **Build info** reports version and build identity without exposing secrets.

Open **Documentation** from the bottom of the Console rail and verify it opens the
same-origin `/docs/0.1/` Help Center. This installed guide is the operator authority
for the running build; public Stable/Development material is secondary.

Complete [first-run setup](first-run.md), then follow [Install Agentic SOC](install.md)
for topology, production ingress, and provider options.

## Connect one narrow source

1. Open **Sources**, choose **Add source**, and select a connector.
2. For a pull source, use a credential limited to read and metadata access on one
   test index or feed. Never use a superuser or service-system account.
3. Set a narrow data scope and map the source fields. Use **Analyze sample** only
   with a representative non-sensitive record; the sample is not persisted.
4. Use **Test connection** where the connector supports it, then save.
5. Send or expose one synthetic alert and confirm its timestamp, rule, severity,
   entities, source identity, and raw provenance in **Logs** and **Cases**.
6. Widen the scope only after the normalized record and resulting case are correct.

HTTP receivers accept supported JSON, NDJSON, CEF, LEEF, GELF, syslog, or key/value
payloads at:

```text
POST /api/ingest/<source-id>
```

The sender must retry non-success responses. UI-supplied source secrets are a
runtime secret tier and must be re-entered after a backend restart; environment
secrets remain the durable deployment tier.

## Verify the workflow

- **Sources** shows configuration and health signals.
- **Logs** shows normalized records and source attribution.
- **Cases** separates source facts, investigator findings, and policy decisions.
- **Cost** records each model call through the single gateway.
- **Audit** records state-changing analyst and agent actions.

## Stop

```bash
./scripts/agentic-soc-compose.sh down
```

The named PostgreSQL volume remains. Adding `--volumes` deletes that state and is
not reversible; use the documented [reset controls](../administration/reset.md)
when you need a scoped, audited reset.

Before internet exposure, review [security](../operations/security.md),
[health and backup](../operations/health-backup.md), and
[known limitations](../releases/known-limitations.md).
