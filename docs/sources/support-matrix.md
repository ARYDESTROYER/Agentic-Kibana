# Source support matrix

The wizard discovers **19 built-in connectors**: 3 pull connectors and 16 push,
queue, or object-store receivers. The default `full` backend image installs every
client named by those manifests. “Installed” still does **not** mean the vendor has
certified this release or that its transport durability has passed a live matrix.

## Status definitions

- **Core + full** — adapter and client are available in both image targets.
- **Full image** — adapter is built in and its pinned optional client is installed by
  the default final image. The deliberately lean `core` target omits that client.
- **Reserved** — the source type exists for compatibility/roadmap purposes; no
  built-in runtime connector is registered.

All sources should be validated against a non-production tenant and a synthetic
alert before wider rollout. Packaging and offline contract tests do not constitute
live-vendor certification for Agentic SOC `0.1.4`.

## Pull sources

| Source | Mode | Image status | Current capability | Boundary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elasticsearch | Pull | Core + full | PIT + `search_after` polling, structured search, fetch by ID, browse, draft connection test | Five-minute late overlap and bounded per-tick page/ID ledger |
| OpenSearch | Pull | Core + full | Same connector contract with OpenSearch provenance and draft connection test | Validate exact distribution; no-PIT offset fallback is not exactly-once during concurrent refresh |
| Wazuh indexer | Pull | Core + full | Reads `wazuh-alerts-*` with Wazuh field defaults and draft connection test | Connect to the indexer, not the dashboard; same PIT/fallback bounds apply |

Pull sources are read-only consumers. Use a credential limited to `read` and index
metadata on the exact log patterns; never use an Elastic superuser,
`kibana_system`, or an OpenSearch/Wazuh administrator.

## Receivers available in core and full images

| Receiver | Mode | Formats/protocol | Important boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Generic webhook | HTTP push | JSON, NDJSON, CEF, LEEF, GELF, key/value | Use bearer or HMAC authentication; `none` is only for a trusted reverse proxy/network |
| Splunk HEC-compatible | HTTP push | HEC event envelope and token authentication | This is an inbound HEC receiver, not a native Splunk search connector |
| Syslog | UDP/TCP/TLS listener | RFC 3164, RFC 5424, RFC 6587 TCP framing | UDP is lossy. TLS requires mounted certificate/private-key paths; optional client-CA verification enables mTLS. Selecting TLS fails closed when its material is missing. |
| Local file/directory | File tail | Auto-detected text formats | Container path must be mounted; byte offsets are process-local in version 0.1 |
| Redis Streams | Queue | Consumer group via the bundled Redis client | Production replay/claim behaviour and multi-replica ownership are not yet certified |

The push path normalises and processes inline. HTTP ingestion returns a retryable
error, Kafka withholds its offset commit, and S3 notification mode retains the queue
message when processing fails. There is not yet a durable receipt/inbox between the
transport and correlation, and not every adapter has equivalent acknowledgement
semantics. The sender or broker must retain and retry until that layer ships.

## Additional adapters in the default full image

The default Docker final stage installs the pinned
`backend/requirements-connectors.txt`; the Python distribution exposes the same set
through the `connectors` extra. Operators who deliberately build `--target core`
omit these clients and should not configure their adapters.

| Source | Mode | Client package in `full` | Current boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Apache Kafka / Redpanda | Queue | `confluent-kafka` | Validate offset commit, rebalance, TLS/SASL, and poison-message behaviour in an integration environment |
| AWS SQS | Queue | `boto3` | Validate visibility timeout and redelivery under slow investigations |
| AWS Kinesis | Queue/stream | `boto3` | Per-shard sequence is persisted after successful emit; validate recovery, expired iterators, and resharding |
| AWS S3 | Object store | `boto3` | List mode persists the last object key; SQS-notification mode retains failed work; JSON/text+gzip work; Parquet does not |
| Azure Event Hubs | Queue | `azure-eventhub` | Default checkpoint path is not durable; add/validate a checkpoint store |
| Azure Blob Storage | Object store | `azure-storage-blob` | Last blob name is persisted; validate overwrite, lexicographic ordering, and late-object behaviour |
| Google Cloud Pub/Sub | Queue | `google-cloud-pubsub` | Validate ack deadline extension and redelivery |
| Google Cloud Storage | Object store | `google-cloud-storage` | Last object name is persisted; validate overwrite, lexicographic ordering, and late-object behaviour |
| RabbitMQ | Queue | `aio-pika` | Validate publisher confirms/dead lettering on the source side and consumer recovery |
| NATS / JetStream | Queue | `nats-py` | Use JetStream for durable consumption; core NATS alone is not replayable |
| MQTT | Queue | `paho-mqtt` | Current callback schedules processing asynchronously, so protocol acknowledgement can precede successful processing; do not use as a loss-intolerant path in version 0.1 |

The distribution contract verifies that every manifest dependency is present in the
full requirement set and that the built wheel contains all modules, runbooks,
playbooks, and registry data. That proves packaging availability, not provider
connectivity. Add live dependency/transport tests for the clients you operate.

## Reserved, not implemented as built-ins

| Family | Reserved source types | Use today |
|---|---|---|
| SIEM search | Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, QRadar, Google Chronicle | Export to an implemented webhook/HEC/queue/object-store receiver, or build an out-of-tree connector |
| EDR/XDR | CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Microsoft Defender | Forward alerts to authenticated webhook/queue transport, or build an out-of-tree connector |
| Forward protocols | Beats/Lumberjack, Fluent forward, OTLP logs, Apache Pulsar | Place a supported forwarder/queue in front, or contribute a connector |

The connector registry supports third-party packages through the
`tlsoc.connectors` Python entry-point group. An out-of-tree connector must still
normalise to OCSF, expose its secret/config schema, preserve source identity, and
obey the same acknowledgement and audit contracts.

## Format and schema coverage

| Input | Parser status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| JSON object/array | Built in | Generic field mapping; validate entity and severity paths |
| NDJSON | Built in | One record per line |
| CEF | Built in | Header and extension parsing; vendor extensions remain in unmapped data |
| LEEF | Built in | LEEF 1/2 delimiter handling |
| GELF | Built in | JSON GELF shape |
| RFC 3164/5424 syslog | Built in | Transport and payload format are separate concerns |
| key/value text | Built in | Best-effort generic mapping |
| gzip object | Built in | Decompressed before text-format detection |
| Parquet / OCSF Security Lake | Not implemented | Do not select the advertised `parquet` hint for production |

Every mapping should be evaluated for timestamp, native ID, rule, severity, user,
host, source/destination address, and source provenance. The target versioned
mapping-assistant workflow is described in
[Ingestion and investigation](../architecture/ingestion.md#normalisation-and-the-mapping-assistant).
