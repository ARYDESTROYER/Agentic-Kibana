# MITRE ATT&CK and threat context

The case **Threat** tab brings together indicator enrichment, MITRE ATT&CK metadata,
and related cases. The service is fail-open: missing enrichment or mapping data does
not prevent case handling.

Reading case threat context requires `cases:read`.

## ATT&CK mappings

Investigations can record technique IDs on a case. Agentic SOC resolves them against its
bundled Enterprise ATT&CK corpus and can fall back from an unavailable sub-technique
to its parent. The mapping is evidence context, not proof that a technique occurred.

Open **Analytics → Metrics → MITRE coverage** to see tactic and technique counts over
cases. The Navigator export uses the ATT&CK Navigator 4.5 layer format. Coverage means
“present on stored cases”; it does not measure preventive-control coverage or test
effectiveness.

## Indicator reputation

Threat context extracts supported observables and runs enabled enrichment providers.
Each result retains provider attribution and raw provider status. A configured
reputation threshold controls how malicious indicators are highlighted; it does not
set the case verdict or disposition.

## Related cases

Cases can be related by shared entities across sources and can belong to an advisory
campaign. Related does not mean merged. Inspect source identity, time overlap, rule
lineage, and evidence before treating two records as one incident.

## How this case was clustered

The Threat tab's three-node explanation shows **Input alerts → Correlation cluster →
Opened case** from fields already persisted on the case. Hover or keyboard-focus a
node to inspect source counts, grouping, matched rule, threshold and time window,
opened-case status/verdict, and bounded related-case links. It is an explanation of
the original correlation—not a second correlation run and not a path that can change
risk or the deterministic decision.

Member alert references are stable one-way hashes and are capped at 12; the response
reports any additional truncated count. Raw source event identifiers and payloads are
not returned. Explicit cross-source links and prior same-entity resolved cases remain
relationships, not force-merges. An older case can truthfully show limited or no
cluster explanation when its persisted metadata predates the feature.

## Imported threat intelligence

Authorized users can import threat-context text into the retrieval corpus with
`rag:manage`. Imported material is treated as untrusted data in model prompts even
when an operator supplied it. It can inform an investigation but cannot change the
deterministic decision policy.

## Analyst checklist

1. Confirm the observable came from the expected source field.
2. Compare multiple providers and their freshness.
3. Validate ATT&CK mappings against the evidence.
4. Inspect the clustering explanation and distinguish correlation evidence from
   advisory cross-source/related-case links.
5. Review related cases for meaningful identity and time overlap.
6. Record the analyst conclusion and disposition in the case.
