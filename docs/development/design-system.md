# Console design system

Agentic SOC keeps visual decisions in a small set of explicit layers. Pages compose
these layers; they do not invent another palette, loader, source icon, control shape,
or motion language.

| Layer | Owns | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Theme | Semantic CSS variables, Light/Dark values, material density, reduced-motion rules | `webui/src/styles/theme.css` |
| Primitives | Accessible shadcn-style wrappers over Radix | `webui/src/ui/` |
| Cross-cutting system | Loading feedback, source identities, stable catalog exports | `webui/src/design-system/` |
| SOC components | Tables, case badges, charts, page anatomy, editors, RBAC guards | `webui/src/soc/components/` |
| Product surfaces | Routed operator workflows | `webui/src/soc/pages/` |

Read the [Console UI standard](ui-standard.md) for the visual and interaction
contract. This page describes where shared implementation belongs.

## Public design-system boundary

Import cross-cutting contracts from `@/design-system`:

```tsx
import { LoadingState, SourceMark } from '@/design-system';
```

The public barrel currently exposes:

- `LoadingState`, `LoadingGlyph`, `LoadingShape`, and the non-blocking `LoadingBar`;
- `SourceMark` and the source-mark metadata;
- `DESIGN_SYSTEM_CATALOG`, a JSON-serializable inventory of the stable component,
  token, asset, and accessibility contracts.

The catalog also documents stable page-anatomy components in their owning modules:
`Card`, `Tabs`, `SegmentedControl`, `ControlBar`, `FilterBar`, `DataTable`,
`EmptyState`, and the divider-led `SettingsCard`. Import these from the module named
in the catalog; they remain SOC/UI-layer components rather than duplicate wrappers in
`src/design-system/`.

Keep page-specific composition in the page or an SOC-domain component. Move a
pattern into `src/design-system/` only when it is genuinely cross-cutting, has a
stable name, works in both themes, has a keyboard/screen-reader contract, and is
covered by focused tests.

## Surface and control grammar

Routine operator surfaces are border-first and quiet:

- `Card` has no resting shadow by default and uses a compact `rounded-md` edge.
  Opt into `elevation="sm"` only when the surface is genuinely detached.
- `Tabs` and `SegmentedControl` use the same squared rail grammar: a 36px outer
  control, compact inner targets, no pill treatment, and no active shadow. Tabs own
  peer panels; segments select one value and expose radiogroup semantics.
- `ControlBar` and `FilterBar` are the page-level action/filter bands. The default
  surface is a hairline section, not another nested card.
- `DataTable` owns a single bounded hairline and a compact shared `EmptyState`.
  Do not wrap the table in decorative elevation. A pointer-clickable row is never
  itself exposed as a button when it can contain checkboxes, links, or menus; provide
  the shared named trailing action, or disable it only when a visible cell already
  contains an equivalent named keyboard action.
- `SettingsCard` is a divider-led section. Related fields live directly in that
  section; an extra card around the whole settings area is a regression.

The Settings workspace composes these primitives with a stable responsive pattern:
one grouped/searchable desktop rail, one compact Sheet chooser on narrow layouts,
one renderer-owned section `h2`, a compact non-heading location/status line, flat
field and switch lanes, and one sticky Save/Discard bar. `SettingsCard`,
`SettingsGrid`, `SettingsTOC`, and `StickySaveBar` remain SOC-layer components; their
catalog entry documents the contract but does not move them into `src/design-system/`.
Section ids, anchor deep links, permission filtering, write-only secrets, and dirty
state belong to the Settings workflow and must survive visual changes. Preference and
write-only-secret drafts protect reload/tab close and pause programmatic cross-page
navigation behind the shared accessible confirmation dialog; same-page section jumps
must keep the mounted draft without prompting.

These rules apply in Light, Dark, and System mode because all colour is semantic-token
driven. Resting shadows, gradients, and decorative animation are not theme substitutes.

## Colour and token ownership

The severity, status, verdict, and risk axes in `theme.css` are measured systems, not
independent swatches. Each axis owns a base fill, a foreground for text placed on that
fill, and an AA standalone-text token. Small text on a semantic wash uses the
standalone-text token, and the contrast gate measures it on the actual card plus 10%
fill composition used by alerts, badges, and notices.

Organisation Branding may change the primary/secondary accent, radius, density,
material chrome, and display font through the bounded allow-list. It cannot override
semantic SOC fills or their derived foreground/text companions. Legacy saved payloads
containing those keys remain loadable, but the client and backend ignore the unsafe
keys rather than splitting the measured contrast and colour-blind-safe pairings.

A custom primary accent is applied identically in Light and Dark. The runtime therefore
derives the higher-contrast black or white `--primary-foreground` from the effective
accent instead of inheriting opposite theme defaults. Before branding is reapplied,
every branding-writable inline token is cleared so removing an override restores the
stylesheet default without stale colour, font, density, radius, or material state.
Display-font preferences stay as stable allow-listed keys on the wire and expand to the
self-hosted font stack only at the DOM boundary. Legacy hex values for primary, ring,
and secondary-accent tokens are normalised to the HSL triplets consumed by the CSS
system before they are written.

## Loading feedback

Use one blocking-load grammar:

- `layout="page"` for application boot or lazy-route boundaries;
- `layout="panel"` for the first load of a contained workflow;
- `layout="table"` when a table has no usable rows yet;
- `layout="inline"` only for a compact, named wait inside an existing surface.

Every blocking state has a visible label and an accessible status name. The shared
Fluent/Material-style indeterminate progress ring is the only animation; the optional
background shape is static and preserves the resolved content footprint. Reduced-motion
users receive the same ring as a static partial arc.

When usable content already exists, keep it mounted and use the slim shared
`LoadingBar` for refresh progress. Button-level work may retain a small spinner
inside that button. Do not add a page-local spinner, bouncing-dot sequence, several
simultaneous shimmer regions, blank canvas, or text-only “Loading”.

## Source identity assets

`SourceMark` provides an original, single-colour vector identity for every built-in
connector type and stable marks for reserved native types. Geometry lives as plain
serializable data under `src/design-system/assets/`; the React renderer inherits
`currentColor`, so semantic contrast remains under the existing theme.

These marks are Agentic SOC artwork, not copied or downloaded vendor logos. This
keeps the application self-contained and avoids an external asset, trademark, or
theme-compatibility dependency. Unknown third-party connectors receive the generic
fallback mark and may supply their accessible connector label.

When adding a connector:

1. add or deliberately select its stable source-mark definition;
2. keep the wire-compatible `sourceType` unchanged;
3. use a simple 24×24 single-colour geometry with no embedded text or raw colour;
4. add it to the machine-readable catalog and focused completeness test;
5. verify the picker/editor in Light, Dark, and a narrow viewport.

## Catalog and future agent tooling

`DESIGN_SYSTEM_CATALOG` is a source-level discovery contract with stable ids,
module/export names, variants, token roles, accessibility requirements, and source
asset metadata. It can later back examples, code generators, or an MCP resource
without scraping JSX.

Version **0.1.8 does not ship a design-system MCP server, endpoint, registry
service, or remote package**. The serializable catalog is the deliberately small
input contract for that future work. A future transport must version its schema
independently and preserve existing token, component, accessibility, and asset ids.

## Change checklist

For a shared-system change:

1. update the implementation and its public barrel export;
2. update `DESIGN_SYSTEM_CATALOG` when the discoverable contract changes;
3. add focused render, accessibility, both-theme, and completeness regressions;
4. use the component in at least one real product surface;
5. run focused tests, TypeScript, lint, design gates, the full Console suite, and
   the production docs-plus-app build;
6. inspect the changed surface in Light, Dark, and a narrow viewport.
